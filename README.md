# README

This base is coppied from a workshop and is very much WIP.
The only changes that have been done atm is the index page, the rest of the files are unchanged as a reference for the full implementation of the code.

Part from the old description:
This is an ES6 "in-house MVC" client application running in the browser
(reason for in-house: Any framework too complex)
The view layer (HTML) uses "Datatables" (jqueryPlugin). Lots of
functionality built in. Possible have to explore a bit.
